# AgentServices -- Data APIs for AI Agents

## Overview

AgentServices provides 50 API endpoints for AI agents, covering crypto data,
on-chain analytics, market intelligence, web research, and AI inference.
Paid endpoints use x402 micropayments ($0.01-$0.25 per call in USDC on Base).
12 endpoints are completely free.

## Quick Start

### Free Endpoints (no payment needed)

```bash
# Crypto prices
curl https://agentservices.to/v1/prices
curl https://agentservices.to/v1/price/BTC

# Market sentiment
curl https://agentservices.to/v1/fear-greed

# Trending assets
curl https://agentservices.to/v1/trending

# Gas prices
curl https://agentservices.to/v1/gas

# News
curl https://agentservices.to/v1/news

# Social signals
curl https://agentservices.to/v1/social
```

### Paid Endpoints (x402 payment)

Paid endpoints return HTTP 402 with payment instructions. Use any x402-compatible
client (e.g., Coinbase agentic wallet) to complete payment automatically.

```python
import requests
from x402 import facilitate

# Example: Get crypto technical indicators
response = requests.get("https://agentservices.to/v1/indicators/BTC")
if response.status_code == 402:
    payment = facilitate(response.json())
    response = requests.get(
        "https://agentservices.to/v1/indicators/BTC",
        headers={"X-PAYMENT": payment.header, "X-402-RECIPIENT": payment.recipient}
    )
print(response.json())
```

## Payment Setup

AgentServices uses the x402 protocol for micropayments. To use paid endpoints:

1. **Coinbase Agentic Wallet (recommended)**: Set up at wallet.coinbase.com
2. **Any x402 client**: Implement the x402 payment flow from the 402 response
3. **CDP Paymaster**: Payments are gasless (no ETH needed, only USDC)

## Use Cases

- **Portfolio Monitoring**: /v1/portfolio gives complete position analysis
- **DeFi Yield Optimization**: /v1/defi-strategy finds best yields with risk assessment
- **Market Intelligence**: /v1/market-pulse for directional signals
- **On-Chain Research**: /v1/onchain-overview for whale + flow analysis
- **Marketing Analysis**: /v1/marketing/* endpoints for competitive intelligence
- **AI Inference**: /v1/inference for LLM-powered analysis
